		<h1>Useless Directory of Commonly Used Websites</h1>
			<p>This website was made to demonstrate my basic ability to use HTML and CSS as part of an assignment from Codify Academy. Codify Academy is a sixteen week program created to help people learn to code and start a new career as a web developer. As the skill is currently in high-demand, education in the field is fairly accessable and able to be learned through means outside of a traditonal college education.</p>
			<p>Above and to the right you will see links to various websites that are commonly visited by most internet users. Obviously, since they are commonly used websites, most people will have no use for a website with links to all of them as they will typically have the urls to each website memorized or bookmarked on their browsers' homepage. Even so, the links provided serve as excellent filler for the spaces labeled "link" on Codify Academy's template.</p>
			<p>For my final paragraph of filler, I will ramble about my obsession with cars. When I was a child, my father was always facinated with automobiles and would always make a point to draw my attention to vehicles he found particularly impressive. This naturally sparked an interest in cars in my young mind. I would often spend hours drawing cars in my art pads. As the years went by and my young brain grew larger and more complex, I was able to learn more about cars and how they function. My interest eventually surpassed my father's, and when I was seventeen years old I purchased my first car: a 1992 Volkswagen Corrado VR6. Since I'v owned that car, I have driven many others, and few have ever sparked excitement the way that car could. After I bought it, it became my hobby, and I spent hours tinkering with it and adding little upgrades to it. Since it was an old German car, it was prone to issues, most of which I was able to fix, but I ultimately decided it was not reliable enough to serve as a suitable daily driver. So, I set it aside as a 'project-car' and purchased a 2010 Subaru Impreza WRX STi. That is the car I currently drive and it is an absolute blast. I have spent countless hours messing around under the hood, and many nights out on the twisty, mountain roads partaking in spirited driving with my fellow enthusiasts. I find that there is no better rush than being behind the wheel of a performance vehicle that you have made your own. End ramble.</p>
